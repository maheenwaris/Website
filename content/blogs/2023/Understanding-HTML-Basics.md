Welcome to the world of web development! If you're new to the field, understanding the basics is essential. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of every web page, and learning a few key HTML tags will set you on the path to creating your own web pages. Let's dive in!

## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language used to structure content on the web. It consists of a series of elements, or "tags," that define the structure and content of a web page. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. Example of closing tag is <html></html> and Example of opening tag is <img>.

## Main HTML Tags for Building a Web Page

Here are some fundamental HTML tags you need to know to create a basic web page:

- 1. `html`: The root element that wraps the entire HTML documents.
- 2. `head`: Contains meta-information about the web page, such as the title and links to external resources.
- 3. `title`: Sets the title of the web page, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- 4. `meta`: Provides metadata about the HTML document, like character encoding and keywords.
- 5. `body`: Contains the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and other elements.
- 6. `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5` and `h6`: Headings of different levels, with `h1` being the highest and most important.
- 7. `p`: Represents paragraphs of text.
- 8. `a`: Creates hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.
- 9. `img`: Embeds (add) images in the web page.
- 10. `ul`: Defines an unordered (bulleted) list.
- 11. `ol`: Defines an ordered (numbered) list.
- 12. `li`: Represents list items within `ul` or `ol` lists.
- 13. `div`: A generic container for grouping and styling content.
- 14. `span`: A inline container for styling a specific portion of text.
- 15. `br`: Inserts a line break (line break tags are self-closing, so no closing tag is needed).

## Creating Your First Web Page

To create your first web page, follow these steps:

- 1. Open a plain text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS).
- 2. Type the following HTML code:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- 3. Save the file with a ".html" extension (e.g: "index.html").
- 4. Open the saved HTML file in a web browser.

Congratulations! You've just created and displayed your first web page using HTML.

#### Conclusion

Understanding HTML and its basic tags is the first step towards becoming a web developer. As you delve deeper into web development, you'll discover more HTML elements and how to combine them with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create dynamic and engaging websites.
