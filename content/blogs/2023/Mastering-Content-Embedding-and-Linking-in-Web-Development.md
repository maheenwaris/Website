In the web development, the ability to integrate various types of content and link between HTML pages is crucial. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, understanding how to embed images, videos, and other media, while effectively linking HTML pages, can greatly enhance engagement of your websites. This guide will give you with the knowledge and skills needed to master these techniques.

## 1. Embedding Images and Videos

### 1.1 Embedding Images with <img> Tag:

The <img> tag is for image embedding. Simply provide the image's source URL using the "src" attribute, and don't forget to include descriptive `alt` text for accessibility.

```html
<img src="image-url.jpg" alt="Description of the image" height="" width="" />
```

In the Above example I use:

Image tag <img>: It's an opening tag as u know.
Two Attribute : "src" to share the location of image & "alt" for text if the image will not display
The "height" and "width" is to set the size of image.
Make sure to save the image in the folder, where your html file exist
